## TODO, is there a way to delay this? or healthcheck the cert-manager webhook
## âœ— Kustomization reconciliation failed: ClusterIssuer/lets-encrypt-production dry-run failed, reason: InternalError,error: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "webhook.cert-manager.io": failed to call webhook: Post "https://cert-manager-webhook.networking.svc:443/mutate?timeout=10s": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
## TODO should these be moved into their respective namespaces, explore this and regular kustomization differences, also using dysnix raw chart for things
